Automatic Featured Images from Videos
=====================================

If a YouTube or Vimeo video exists in the first few paragraphs of a post, automatically set the post's featured image to that video's thumbnail. Will not set the thumbnail if there is already a thumbnail. Also sets an `_is_video` post meta key.
