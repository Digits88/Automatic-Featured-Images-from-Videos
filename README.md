Automatic Featured Images from Videos
=====================================

If a YouTube or Vimeo video exists in the first few paragraphs of a post, automatically set the post's featured image to that vidoe's thumbnail. Will not set the thumbnail if there is already a thumbnail. Also sets a '_is_video' post meta key.
